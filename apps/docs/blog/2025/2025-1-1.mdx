### React 19 Support

RizzUI now supports React 19. You can now use the latest version of React with RizzUI.

<br />

### Versioned Doc

We have introduced versioned documentation for RizzUI. You can now switch between different versions of the documentation to view the changes and updates made in each version.

<br />

### Tree Shaking

RizzUI now supports tree shaking. You can now import components individually or in bulk.

<br />

### Client Components

Whenever you are importing these components you have to use `"use-client"` as a prefix. Because of the use cases of these components they are mostly used in the client side.

**Example:**

```jsx
// highlight-next-line
"use-client";

import { Input } from "rizzui/input";

export default App () {
  return (
    <Input label="Input" />
  );
}
```

<br />

<br />

### Server Components

Components that supports server side rendering. Whenever you are importing these components you don't need to use `"use-client"` as a prefix. But if you are using events like **onClick**, **onChange** etc. you have to use `"use-client"` as a prefix.

**Example:**

```jsx
import { Button } from "rizzui/button";

export default App () {
  return (
    <Button>Click Me</Button>
  );
}
```

**Example:** if you are using events

```jsx
// highlight-next-line
"use-client";

import { Button } from "rizzui/button";

export default App () {
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>Click Me</Button>
  );
}
```

<br />

### Integrated Components

These components are categorized as integration components due to their varied use cases. To use them, simply copy and paste the code from the documentation into your project. You can customize them to fit your requirements. By default, if you copy the code from the documentation, they will support our design system.
